# Generative AI Agent Supervisor Project

Welcome to the Generative AI Agent Supervisor Project! This project demonstrates how to use advanced design patterns in LangChain and LangGraph to build a sophisticated agent-based system. With good guidance, you can do anything. Have faith in yourself and break through all the difficulties in life. ðŸŒŸ


**#The Project**

While individual agents can perform well in specific domains with a limited toolset, even advanced models like GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct often struggle with complex tasks that require a variety of tools and expertise. To address these challenges, a common strategy is to create specialized agents for distinct tasks or domains, routing tasks to the most suitable 'expert'. Inspired by the research of Wu et al., this notebook demonstrates how to implement this approach using LangGraph.
